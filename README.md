# Heart_Disease_Prediction
The proposed model here predicts heart disease by exploring three classification algorithms
1. k neighbors classification
2. logistic regression
3. random forest classifier
4. and does performance analysis using various evaluation metrics such as Randomized Search CV,Grid Search CV , confusion_matrix,classification_report ,precision_score,recall_score,f1_score,accuracy_score the objective of this model is to predict if the patient suffers from heart disease.the health professional enters the input values from the patient's health report . the data is fed into the model which predicts the probability of having heart disease.
